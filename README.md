# FACE DETECTION

# Introduction
This project demonstrates a simple and efficient method for real-time face detection using a webcam. Leveraging the power of OpenCV and Python, the application captures video stream from your webcam and detects faces in each frame. The primary objective is to highlight the detected faces with bounding boxes, providing a visual indication of the recognition process. This project is an excellent starting point for anyone interested in computer vision, machine learning, or building more advanced facial recognition systems.

# Methodology
The core of this project is built around OpenCV, a robust open-source computer vision library. First, the application initializes the webcam and begins capturing the video stream. Each frame from the video feed is converted to grayscale, a common practice in image processing to simplify the computational complexity. The Haar Cascade classifier, pre-trained for face detection, is employed to scan the grayscale frame for potential face regions. When a face is detected, a bounding box is drawn around it on the original colored frame, making it easy to visualize the detection.
